## 1. Role Definition: Game Marketing Specialist

### What This Role Covers

Quark is not a generic marketer. Quark is a **Game Marketing Specialist** for a small indie studio launching premium (paid, no ads) mobile games on the App Store. This means:

- **App Store Optimization (ASO)** is the primary discipline. Every character of metadata, every pixel of screenshots, every second of preview video is conversion engineering.
- **Community-driven marketing** over paid advertising. Small studios can't outspend big publishers. They can out-care them.
- **Premium positioning** in a free-to-play world. We don't compete on price -- we compete on quality, trust, and the "Buy Once, Own Forever" promise.
- **Launch velocity** is everything. The App Store algorithm rewards download velocity in short windows. A weak launch is nearly impossible to recover from.

### Core Marketing Philosophy

1. **Discovery is a funnel, not a lottery.** Every step from keyword search to download is a conversion point we engineer.
2. **Premium games sell on trust.** Screenshots, ratings, and descriptions must communicate "this is worth real money" in under 3 seconds.
3. **The community IS the marketing.** 500 genuine fans outperform $50K in ads for a $2.99 game.
4. **Launch is not day one -- launch is the 90 days surrounding day one.** Pre-launch builds momentum. Launch week captures it. Post-launch sustains it.
5. **Profit requires margin discipline.** Revenue minus Apple's 30% minus any marketing spend equals actual money. A $2.99 game at Apple's small business program rate (15% commission) yields ~$2.54 per sale. Every dollar of marketing spend must return at least $5 in revenue.

### Budget Reality for Small Studios

**Micro Budget ($1K-$5K total marketing spend):**
- 40% on paid social ads concentrated around launch week ($400-$2,000)
- 25% on key creation/distribution for influencers ($250-$1,250)
- 20% on professional visual assets: trailer editing, screenshot polish ($200-$1,000)
- 15% on tools and subscriptions ($150-$750)

**Working Budget ($10K-$50K):**
- 35% on influencer marketing: organic outreach plus 2-5 paid sponsorships timed to launch
- 25% on paid advertising: Meta, TikTok, Reddit
- 20% on professional assets: trailer, screenshots, press kit
- 10% on PR and press outreach
- 10% on community tools and events

**The honest truth:** For a $2.99 indie game, marketing budget should be minimal and effort-heavy. Sweat equity (your time creating content, engaging communities, building relationships) is the primary investment. Cash spend should be surgical and launch-concentrated.

## 2. App Store Optimization (ASO) Complete Guide

ASO is the single most important marketing discipline for a mobile game. It determines whether players can find you and whether they download once they do. An optimized App Store gallery can increase conversion rate by up to 40%.

### 2.1 The Metadata Stack

The App Store indexes and displays several metadata fields. Each has constraints and strategic purpose:

| Field | Character Limit | Indexed for Search? | Strategic Purpose |
|-------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **App Name** | 30 characters | Yes (highest weight) | Brand + primary keyword |
| **Subtitle** | 30 characters | Yes (high weight) | Secondary keywords + value proposition |
| **Keyword Field** | 100 characters | Yes | Broad keyword coverage |
| **Description** | 4,000 characters | No (Apple does NOT index descriptions) | Conversion copy only |
| **Promotional Text** | 170 characters | No | Time-sensitive messaging, updatable without review |
| **What's New** | 4,000 characters | No | Retention, re-engagement |
| **Category** | Primary + Secondary | Yes | Genre positioning |
| **In-App Purchases** | Display name + description | Yes (low weight) | Additional keyword surface |

### 2.2 App Name (30 Characters)

**Rules:**
- Most heavily weighted metadata field for search ranking
- Must include brand name AND primary keyword
- Apple rejects keyword-stuffing names

**Strategy:**
- Format: `Brand Name - Primary Keyword Phrase`
- The brand name should be memorable and unique (less competition)
- The keyword phrase should be the highest-volume, most relevant search term

**For Oasis:**
- `Oasis - Dungeon Crawler RPG` (27 chars) -- strong keywords, clear genre
- `Oasis: Roguelike Dungeon RPG` (28 chars) -- adds "roguelike" signal
- `Oasis - Dark Fantasy Crawler` (28 chars) -- differentiates on art style

### 2.3 Subtitle (30 Characters)

**Rules:**
- Appears directly under the app name in search results and product page
- Indexed for search (high weight)
- The last word in a full 30-character subtitle may NOT index (known bug) -- place important terms earlier
- Should complement the title, not repeat it

**Strategy:**
- Use for secondary keywords that didn't fit in the title
- Make it benefit-oriented where possible
- Never repeat words from the title (wastes indexing)

**For Oasis:**
- `Quick-Run Fantasy Dungeon Loot` (30 chars) -- session length + genre + reward
- `Permadeath Runs, Epic Loot` (26 chars) -- mechanic + reward
- `16 Builds. Permadeath. Loot.` (28 chars) -- depth + mechanic + reward

### 2.4 Keyword Field (100 Characters)

**Rules:**
- Separated by commas, NO spaces after commas
- Not visible to users
- Do NOT repeat words from the title or subtitle (they're already indexed)
- Avoid plurals (Apple handles pluralization automatically)
- Avoid "the", "a", "and" -- they waste characters
- Apple automatically creates combinations from individual words
- Use single words, not phrases -- the algorithm combines them

**Strategy:**
1. Start with competitor names and genre terms
2. Add mechanic-specific terms (permadeath, procedural, loot)
3. Add audience terms (offline, no wifi, no ads)
4. Add thematic terms (fantasy, medieval, dungeon, underground)
5. Fill remaining space with long-tail discovery terms

**Keyword Research Process:**
1. List 50+ candidate keywords from genre, mechanics, themes, competitors
2. Check search volume using ASO tools (AppTweak, Sensor Tower, AppFollow)
3. Check competition level for each keyword
4. Score: `relevance x volume / competition`
5. Pack the 100 characters with highest-scoring single words
6. Verify no word repeats from title or subtitle

**Example keyword field for Oasis (hypothetical):**
```
roguelite,turn,action,hack,slash,class,warrior,mage,healer,thief,boss,procedural,pixel,retro,dark,indie,premium,offline,adventure,explore,combat,sword,magic,skill,build,session,quick,run,die,retry
```
(Count every character. Maximize density. No spaces after commas.)

### 2.5 Description (4,000 Characters -- NOT Indexed)

Since Apple does NOT index the description for search, this field is purely for conversion. A user who reads your description has already found you -- now you need to close the sale.

**Structure:**

```
[Hook paragraph: 2-3 sentences. Lead with the experience, not features.]

[Bullet list: 5-7 key features, most compelling first]

[Social proof paragraph: awards, ratings, press quotes if available]

[Studio identity: Buy Once Own Forever. No ads. No in-app purchases.]

[Call to action: Download now.]
```

**First paragraph is critical.** Only ~2-3 lines show before "More" is tapped. This must hook immediately.

**For games:**
- Lead with the FEELING of playing, not the feature list
- "Descend into procedurally generated dungeons..." not "Features 5 dungeon floors..."
- Use power words: master, conquer, survive, discover, unleash
- Mention session length for mobile ("Perfect for 10-minute sessions")

### 2.6 Category Selection

**Primary Category:** Games > Role Playing
**Secondary Category:** Games > Action

Category affects:
- Which top charts you appear on
- Which "browse" sections surface your game
- Keyword associations Apple makes

Choose the category where you can realistically rank, not the biggest one. "Role Playing" is more specific than "Action" and better targets the right audience.

### 2.7 In-App Purchases as Keyword Surface

If Oasis ever adds IAP (cosmetic DLC, expansion content), the IAP display names and descriptions are indexed by Apple's search algorithm. This creates additional keyword surface area.

Even tip jars or "Support the Developer" IAPs can use keyword-rich descriptions:
- "Adventurer's Tip Jar - Support indie dungeon crawlers"

## 3. Launch Strategy Timeline

### 3.1 Pre-Launch Phase (Weeks -8 to -1)

This phase builds the foundation. Without it, launch day is shouting into void.

#### Week -8 to -6: Foundation

- [ ] **Create landing page** with email signup (Carrd.co, $19/year). Purpose: capture emails, have a URL to share everywhere.
- [ ] **Set up social accounts**: Twitter/X, TikTok, Reddit accounts. Post first devlog content.
- [ ] **Create Discord server** with channels: #announcements, #dev-updates, #general, #feedback, #screenshots
- [ ] **Start posting development content**: GIFs of gameplay, art process, behind-the-scenes. 3-5 posts per week across platforms.
- [ ] **Begin Reddit community participation**: Spend 2+ weeks engaging genuinely in r/roguelikes, r/IndieGaming, r/iosgaming, r/AndroidGaming, r/roguelites BEFORE posting about your game.
- [ ] **Create presskit** (presskit.html or equivalent): game description, screenshots (high-res), logo, studio info, trailer embed, factsheet.

#### Week -5 to -3: Building Momentum

- [ ] **Ramp TikTok content**: Daily or 3-5x weekly. Vertical gameplay clips, bug compilations, "I didn't expect this," dev reactions. Use trending sounds.
- [ ] **Contact micro-influencers**: Identify 20-30 YouTubers/TikTokers in the roguelike/indie game space (5K-100K followers). Send personalized emails with TestFlight access.
- [ ] **Set up App Store pre-order** (available up to 180 days before launch, but 4-6 weeks is the sweet spot). This lets the product page start indexing keywords and building pre-order volume.
- [ ] **Submit Featuring Nomination** in App Store Connect. Apple recommends 3 months lead time, but at minimum, give 2 weeks. Highlight: original art, premium model, indie studio, accessibility features.
- [ ] **Write press outreach emails** and build journalist contact list (TouchArcade, PocketGamer, AppSpy, 148Apps, indie game journalists).

#### Week -2 to -1: Launch Prep

- [ ] **Send press emails**: Provide TestFlight codes directly (don't ask "would you like a code?" -- just include it). Short, personalized emails. Include trailer link, presskit link, and 3-sentence game description.
- [ ] **Finalize App Store listing**: All metadata polished, screenshots final, preview video uploaded, keyword field optimized.
- [ ] **Schedule launch day social posts** across all platforms.
- [ ] **Send newsletter to email list**: "Launching in X days!" with pre-order link.
- [ ] **Post "launching soon" on Discord and all social channels**.
- [ ] **A/B test product page elements** if time permits (requires enough traffic).

### 3.2 Launch Week (Days 0-7)

**Launch day is the most important single day for the game's App Store life.** Download velocity in the first 24-72 hours has outsized impact on algorithm ranking.

#### Day 0 (Launch Day)

- [ ] **Release the app** (change pre-order to available, or submit for release)
- [ ] **Blast all channels simultaneously**: Newsletter, Discord, Twitter/X, TikTok, Reddit (multiple subreddits), Instagram
- [ ] **Post on Reddit**: r/IndieGaming, r/roguelikes, r/iosgaming, r/roguelites, r/gamedev (with appropriate framing per community rules)
- [ ] **Email press list** with "NOW AVAILABLE" follow-up
- [ ] **Activate influencer coverage**: Coordinate with any creators who agreed to launch-day content
- [ ] **Post TikTok launch video**: Gameplay montage, 15-30 seconds, trending sound, text overlay with price and App Store link
- [ ] **Run targeted ads** if budget allows: Reddit (r/roguelikes targeting), TikTok (gaming interest), Meta (mobile gaming audiences)
- [ ] **Respond to every comment, review, and mention** within hours. Day 1 engagement velocity matters.

#### Days 1-3

- [ ] **Continue posting content**: Different angle each day (combat showcase, class comparison, boss fights, speedrun attempt)
- [ ] **Monitor and respond to App Store reviews immediately**
- [ ] **Track keyword rankings** and adjust if any quick wins are available
- [ ] **Share positive reviews and player reactions** on social
- [ ] **Post "thank you" content** if milestones hit (100 downloads, first 5-star review, etc.)

#### Days 4-7

- [ ] **Analyze first-week data**: Downloads, conversion rate, keyword rankings, revenue
- [ ] **Adjust ads** based on ROAS (return on ad spend)
- [ ] **Gather feedback** for first update
- [ ] **Continue daily social posting**

### 3.3 Post-Launch Phase (Weeks 2-12)

The long game. Most indie games make their living in post-launch, not launch week.

#### Weeks 2-4: Sustain and Optimize

- [ ] **Ship first update** with bug fixes and player-requested improvements. This triggers "What's New" visibility and re-engagement.
- [ ] **Run Product Page Optimization A/B tests** on screenshots (requires sufficient traffic)
- [ ] **Continue weekly TikTok/social content**
- [ ] **Engage community**: Feature player achievements, respond to feedback, tease upcoming content
- [ ] **Review keyword performance** and iterate metadata

#### Months 2-3: Growth and Content

- [ ] **Ship content update** (new dungeon floor, new class, new boss). Content updates are marketing events.
- [ ] **Coordinate update with press and influencer outreach** -- treat major updates like mini-launches
- [ ] **Consider limited-time price drop** to $0.99 for a weekend to spike downloads and climb charts. Restore to $2.99 after.
- [ ] **Cross-promote with other indie devs** (social media shoutouts, guest appearances on each other's Discord)
- [ ] **Submit for Indie Game showcases** (WWDC Indie Spotlight, App Store "Indie Game of the Week" curation)

#### Ongoing

- [ ] **Monthly content posts**: Keep the game in conversations
- [ ] **Respond to all App Store reviews** (especially negative ones -- professional, helpful responses)
- [ ] **Track competitor keywords** and adjust metadata seasonally
- [ ] **Build toward Phase 2** (Forge&Table) and cross-promote

## 4. Marketing Channel Guide

### 4.1 Channel Priority Matrix (Small Indie Studio)

| Channel | Cost | Time Investment | Impact for Premium Mobile | Priority |
|---------|------|----------------|--------------------------|----------|
| **App Store Optimization** | Free | High (ongoing) | Critical -- 65% of downloads come from search | #1 |
| **TikTok** | Free | High (daily posting) | High -- viral potential, visual game content | #2 |
| **Reddit** | Free | Medium (genuine participation) | High -- targeted niche communities | #3 |
| **Discord** | Free | Medium (community management) | Medium-High -- core fan retention | #4 |
| **Twitter/X** | Free | Medium | Medium -- gamedev community, journalists | #5 |
| **Press/Influencer Outreach** | Low ($0-keys) | Medium | Medium -- credibility, coverage | #6 |
| **YouTube Influencers** | Low-Medium | Low (after outreach) | Medium -- long-form content lives forever | #7 |
| **Email Newsletter** | Low ($0-20/mo) | Low | Medium -- direct, high conversion | #8 |
| **Instagram** | Free | Low | Low-Medium -- good for art-heavy games | #9 |
| **Paid Ads (Meta/TikTok)** | Medium-High | Low | Low for $2.99 games (hard to get positive ROAS) | #10 |
| **Apple Search Ads** | Medium | Low | Medium -- direct App Store placement | #11 |

### 4.2 Reddit Strategy (Deep Dive)

Reddit is the highest-potential free marketing platform for indie games, but the culture is hostile to anything that feels promotional. This is a participation platform, not a broadcast platform.

**Subreddits for Roguelike Dungeon Crawlers:**

| Subreddit | Subscribers | Best Content Type | Rules to Know |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|---------------|
| r/roguelikes | ~200K | Gameplay GIFs, design discussions | Strict definition of "roguelike" -- know the distinction |
| r/roguelites | ~50K | More lenient on genre definition | Good for action-roguelites |
| r/IndieGaming | ~400K | Gameplay clips, launch announcements | Self-promotion rules exist -- check sidebar |
| r/iosgaming | ~300K | iOS-specific, actively seeks recommendations | Very receptive to premium games |
| r/gamedev | ~1.5M | Development process, postmortems | NOT for promotion -- share knowledge |
| r/IndieDev | ~200K | Dev screenshots, progress updates | Community-friendly to WIP |
| r/AndroidGaming | ~400K | Future-proofing if Android port happens | -- |
| r/gaming | ~40M+ | Only for truly impressive/viral content | Will be buried unless exceptional |

**Reddit Posting Playbook:**
1. Participate genuinely for 2+ weeks before any self-promotion
2. Titles that work: "How I built a procedural dungeon generator," "What we learned making our first roguelike," "After 6 months, here's our indie dungeon crawler"
3. Lead with value, link to game as secondary
4. GIFs and short videos dramatically outperform text posts
5. Post during US evening hours (6-10 PM ET) for maximum visibility
6. Never post the same content to multiple subreddits simultaneously -- space it out, vary the angle

### 4.3 TikTok Strategy (Deep Dive)

TikTok's algorithm gives small accounts equal viral potential. For a visually interesting game like Oasis, this is the highest-ceiling free marketing channel.

**Content Types That Work:**

| Content Type | Example | Why It Works |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| **Gameplay clips** | 15-sec boss fight montage | Shows the game IS fun |
| **Dev reactions** | "I did NOT expect players to do this" | Human connection + gameplay |
| **Bug compilations** | Physics bugs, hilarious deaths | Humor drives shares |
| **Before/after** | "This room looked like THIS 3 months ago" | Progress is satisfying |
| **Class showcases** | "Pick your fighter: Mage vs Rogue" | Engagement bait + game depth |
| **Speedrun attempts** | "Can I beat the final boss in under 2 minutes?" | Tension + gameplay |
| **Art process** | Timelapse of creating a boss sprite | Behind-the-scenes appeal |
| **Permadeath moments** | "I was ONE hit away from winning..." | Emotional gameplay moments |

**TikTok Posting Rules:**
- Vertical (9:16) is mandatory. Never upload a 16:9 gameplay trailer.
- 15-30 seconds is the sweet spot. Under 60 seconds.
- Use trending sounds -- the algorithm favors them
- Text overlay is essential (many watch without sound)
- Post 3-5x per week minimum, daily during launch window
- Hashtags: #IndieGame #GameDev #Roguelike #DungeonCrawler #MobileGaming #iOSGaming #IndieDev
- Respond to comments with video responses -- the algorithm loves this
- Best posting times: 6-10 PM in your target audience's timezone

### 4.4 Press and Influencer Outreach

**Press Email Template:**

```
Subject: [Game Name] - [One-line hook]

Hi [Name],

[Game Name] is a [genre] for [platform] where [one sentence about the core experience].

[One sentence about what makes it unique].

It launches [date] at [$X.XX] -- no ads, no in-app purchases.

Here's a TestFlight code: [CODE]
Press kit: [URL]
Trailer: [URL]

Happy to answer any questions.

[Your name]
[Studio name]
```

**Key Press Outlets for Mobile Indie Games:**
- TouchArcade (dedicated iOS gaming -- high value)
- PocketGamer.biz (mobile gaming business + reviews)
- AppSpy (iOS/Android game reviews)
- 148Apps (iOS app reviews)
- Indie Game Reporter / The Indie Informer
- Game Developer (postmortems and developer stories)

**Influencer Outreach Rules:**
- Target micro-influencers (5K-100K followers) -- higher engagement rates, more likely to respond
- Send free codes, never ask "would you like one?" -- just provide it
- Don't require anything -- genuine enthusiasm converts better than obligations
- Influencer campaigns cost $0.50-$3.00 per wishlist equivalent
- 3x more cost-effective than social media advertising

### 4.5 Discord Community Building

**Server Structure for an Indie Game:**

```
WELCOME
  #rules
  #announcements
  #faq

COMMUNITY
  #general
  #screenshots-and-clips
  #tips-and-strategies
  #class-discussion (Fighter, Rogue, Mage, Cleric)
  #bug-reports
  #feature-requests

DEV UPDATES
  #dev-log
  #patch-notes
  #behind-the-scenes
  #polls-and-feedback

FUN
  #off-topic
  #memes
  #speedrun-leaderboard
```

**Community Management Rules:**
- A server with 500 genuinely engaged members is worth more than 5,000 silent ones
- Post dev updates at least weekly
- Respond to feedback publicly -- show players their input matters
- Create roles for active community members ("Dungeon Delver," "Boss Slayer")
- Run community events: screenshot contests, speedrun challenges, build showcases
- NEVER make the Discord just an announcement channel -- that's a dead server

---

## 5. Pricing Strategy Analysis

### 5.1 The Premium Mobile Landscape

The mobile market is dominated by free-to-play (F2P). Premium (paid upfront) games represent a small but loyal segment. The challenge: convincing users to pay upfront when 95%+ of games are free.

**Premium mobile games that succeeded:**

| Game | Price | Revenue Model | What Worked |
|------|-------|--------------|-------------|
| Stardew Valley | $4.99 | One-time purchase, all content included | PC reputation, word of mouth, depth |
| Slay the Spire | $9.99 | One-time purchase | PC/console reputation, genre-defining |
| Dead Cells | $8.99 | One-time purchase + paid DLC | Established franchise, quality port |
| Vampire Survivors | Free + opt-in ads | F2P with non-intrusive monetization | PC viral success, mass appeal |
| Celeste | $4.99-7.99 | One-time purchase | Critical acclaim, prestige |
| Alto's Odyssey | $4.99 | One-time purchase (later went free) | Art style, casual appeal, Apple featuring |
| Hades | Netflix bundle | Premium via Netflix Games | Supergiant reputation, GOTY acclaim |
| Shattered Pixel Dungeon | Free (donations) | Open source, tip jar | Community-driven, niche dedication |
| Monument Valley | $3.99 | One-time purchase + paid sequel | Art, Apple featuring, word of mouth |

### 5.2 Price Point Analysis for $2.99

**Why $2.99 is a strong choice for Oasis:**

- **Low enough for impulse purchase**: Under the psychological $5 threshold. Most users won't agonize over $2.99.
- **High enough to signal quality**: $0.99 games are perceived as throwaway. $2.99 says "this is a real game."
- **Healthy margin**: At Apple's small business program rate (15% commission for developers earning under $1M/year), $2.99 yields ~$2.54 per sale.
- **Promotion room**: Can temporarily drop to $0.99 for chart-climbing promotions, then restore to $2.99.
- **Comparable to genre**: Many mobile roguelikes sit at $1.99-$4.99.

**Revenue math:**
- 1,000 downloads x $2.54 net = $2,540
- 5,000 downloads x $2.54 net = $12,700
- 10,000 downloads x $2.54 net = $25,400
- 50,000 downloads x $2.54 net = $127,000

**Break-even on Apple Developer fee ($99/year):** ~39 sales.

### 5.3 Regional Pricing

Apple provides price tiers with automatic regional equivalents. For $2.99 USD (Tier 3):
- Apple automatically sets localized prices across all territories
- Alternate Tier A and Tier B offer lower prices for emerging markets (India, Brazil, etc.)
- Consider using Alternate Tiers to capture developing markets where $2.99 USD equivalent is expensive
- Regional pricing adjustments have shown revenue increases of 22-55% in case studies

**Strategy:** Use Apple's standard pricing for launch. After gathering data on where downloads come from, consider regional adjustments for underperforming high-population markets.

### 5.4 Promotional Pricing Tactics

- **Launch week discount**: NOT recommended. Launch at full price to maximize revenue during highest-traffic period.
- **Post-launch dip** (Month 2-3): Drop to $0.99 for one weekend. This can spike downloads, improve chart position, and generate "on sale" visibility in deal-tracking communities.
- **Update launches**: Temporarily reduce price when shipping major content updates to re-enter the "new and updated" visibility.
- **Never go free permanently** unless the monetization model changes. Free devalues the brand and sets expectations.

### 5.5 The Buy Once Own Forever Advantage

This is a genuine competitive moat, not just a philosophy. Market it explicitly:

- **In the App Store subtitle or description**: "No ads. No in-app purchases. The full game."
- **On social media**: Contrast with F2P frustrations ("No energy timers. No gacha. No surprise mechanics. Just a game.")
- **In the App Store What's New**: "Free update! All new content included. Because you already own the game."
- **In press outreach**: Journalists actively seek premium alternatives to cover

Players ACTIVELY SEARCH for premium alternatives. "no ads game" and "premium RPG" are real search queries with volume. Position against the F2P ocean.

## 6. Screenshots & Preview Video Best Practices

### 6.1 Screenshots

Screenshots are the most impactful conversion element on the product page. Users typically decide within 3-5 seconds of seeing them. An optimized screenshot gallery can increase conversion by up to 40%.

**Apple Requirements:**
- Up to 10 screenshots per device size per localization
- Required sizes: 6.7" (iPhone 15 Pro Max), 6.5" (iPhone 11 Pro Max), 5.5" (iPhone 8 Plus), iPad Pro 12.9" (both generations)
- Can be portrait or landscape (63% of mobile games use landscape)

**The First Three Rule:**
The first three screenshots have the most influence. Users rarely scroll past them. These three must:
1. Show the CORE gameplay experience (combat, dungeon exploration)
2. Communicate the art style and quality bar
3. Include text overlays that state the value proposition

**Screenshot Narrative Structure (10 screenshots):**

| # | Purpose | Example for Oasis |
|---|---------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Hero shot** -- best single moment of gameplay | Combat scene: player character fighting multiple enemies in a beautiful dungeon, spell effects flying. Text: "Descend Into Darkness" |
| 2 | **Core loop** -- what you DO in the game | Dungeon exploration with loot drops visible. Text: "Procedural Dungeons. Every Run Is Different." |
| 3 | **Unique hook** -- what makes THIS game special | Character selection showing 16 class/race combos. Text: "16 Unique Builds to Master" |
| 4 | **Depth signal** -- show there's more here | Ability tree or equipment screen. Text: "Deep RPG Systems" |
| 5 | **Boss fight** -- spectacle moment | Boss battle with dramatic effects. Text: "Epic Boss Battles" |
| 6 | **Progression** -- what you earn | Unlock screen showing new abilities and cosmetics. Text: "Persistent Unlocks Across Runs" |
| 7 | **Session pitch** -- mobile suitability | Gameplay with subtle time indicator. Text: "10-Minute Runs. Perfect On the Go." |
| 8 | **Art showcase** -- visual quality | Most beautiful environment in the game. Text: "Hand-Painted Dark Fantasy Art" |
| 9 | **Trust signal** -- premium value | Clean UI shot. Text: "No Ads. No In-App Purchases. The Full Game." |
| 10 | **Call to action** -- studio identity | Game logo + studio logo. Text: "Forge&Code -- Buy Once, Own Forever." |

**Screenshot Design Rules:**
- Use actual gameplay footage (Apple requires it)
- Text overlays: large, readable, high contrast. Max 5-7 words per screenshot.
- Colors: high contrast, bold. Blues and greens convey trust. Reds and oranges create excitement.
- Show the game running on a device OR borderless -- both work, test which converts better
- For games: character-focused icons perform better on iOS than gameplay-focused ones
- Maintain consistent visual language across all 10 screenshots

### 6.2 App Preview Videos

App previews autoplay (muted) on the product page and in search results. They appear BEFORE screenshots. A well-made preview can significantly boost conversion.

**Apple Requirements:**
- Up to 3 preview videos per localization
- Each preview: 15-30 seconds maximum
- Must show real in-app experience (at least 80% actual gameplay/footage)
- No device mockups or stylized animations
- Captured on device (can be recorded via QuickTime from device)

**Preview Video Structure (30 seconds):**

```
0-3s:   Hook -- most exciting moment (boss fight, dramatic death, epic loot)
3-10s:  Core gameplay -- dungeon exploration, combat
10-18s: Variety -- different classes, different dungeons, abilities
18-25s: Depth -- progression, unlocks, character builds
25-30s: Logo + "Available Now" + Price
```

**Production Tips:**
- Record on the actual device for authenticity
- No narration needed -- text overlays work better (many watch without sound)
- Cut fast -- 2-3 second shots maximum. Keep energy high.
- Show the best of the game -- this is a commercial, not a walkthrough
- Music should be the game's actual soundtrack (builds authenticity)
- The first 3 seconds determine if users keep watching -- lead with action

### 6.3 App Icon

The icon is the first thing users see in search results. It determines tap-through rate. An optimized icon can increase conversions by 10-30%.

**Design Principles for Game Icons:**
- Single focal element (one character, one symbol)
- Bold, saturated colors that stand out against the white App Store background
- No text (too small to read at icon size)
- Character-focused performs better than gameplay-focused on iOS
- Must be recognizable at 29x29px (smallest rendered size)

**For Oasis:**
- A striking character (warrior, mage) from the game's art style
- Dark fantasy palette with a pop of magical color (glowing weapon, spell effect)
- The character should face the viewer or be in an action pose
- Background should be simple and dark to make the character pop

**A/B Testing:**
Use Product Page Optimization in App Store Connect to test icon variants. Bold changes produce more statistically significant results. Test character vs. symbol, different characters, different color palettes.

## 7. Community Building for Indie Games

### 7.1 Why Community is the Marketing

For a small studio with a $2.99 game, traditional advertising is usually ROAS-negative. You cannot outspend big publishers. What you CAN do:

- Build genuine relationships with players who become evangelists
- Create a loyal base that reviews, shares, and defends your game
- Generate word-of-mouth that no ad budget can buy
- Get direct feedback that makes the game better (which improves ratings, which improves conversion)

### 7.2 The Community Flywheel

```
Great Game --> Happy Players --> Positive Reviews --> Better ASO Ranking
     ^                              |
     |                              v
Better Game <-- Player Feedback <-- Community Engagement
```

Every step feeds the next. The community IS the marketing engine.

### 7.3 Community Building Timeline

**Before Launch:**
- Start sharing development content 6-8 weeks before launch
- Open Discord when you have something to show (not just a logo)
- Build relationships in existing communities (Reddit, genre-specific Discords)
- Let early testers (TestFlight) become founding community members

**At Launch:**
- Activate community for launch-day downloads (velocity matters!)
- Feature community members' achievements
- Create shared experiences ("Who's beaten the final boss first?")

**After Launch:**
- Weekly dev updates (even small ones)
- Community events: challenges, contests, speedrun competitions
- Player spotlight features
- Transparent roadmap -- let the community see what's coming
- Act on community feedback and credit them when you do

### 7.4 The 1,000 True Fans Math

For a $2.99 game:
- 1,000 true fans = $2,540 net revenue (one sale each)
- But true fans also: review (boosting ASO), share on social (free marketing), buy DLC/sequels, join Discord (providing feedback)
- 1,000 true fans with word-of-mouth can generate 5,000-10,000 total sales
- This math WORKS for premium indie. It does NOT work for F2P.

---

## 8. Reviews & Ratings Strategy

### 8.1 Why Ratings Are Critical

- Apps rated 4.5+ are twice as likely to appear in Top 50 search results
- 90% of Apple-featured apps maintain 4.0+ ratings
- Ratings directly correlate with conversion rate (users check before downloading)
- Rating is visible in search results -- it's the first trust signal after the icon

### 8.2 When to Prompt for Reviews

Apple's `SKStoreReviewController` allows up to 3 prompts per 365-day period. Using the native prompt (vs. directing to App Store) generates 3-5x more responses.

**Optimal Timing for a Roguelike:**

| Trigger | Why | Implementation |
|---------|-----|----------------|
| After first boss kill | Player has experienced the core loop and succeeded | Post-victory celebration screen |
| After 5th completed run | Player is engaged and returning | Run summary screen |
| After unlocking first persistent reward | Player feels progression and investment | Unlock celebration screen |

**Gating Conditions (ALL must be true):**
- No crash in last session
- At least 3 sessions completed
- At least 7 days since install
- No open bug report
- 90+ days since last prompt
- Positive gameplay event just occurred

**What NOT to Do:**
- Never prompt on first launch or during onboarding
- Never prompt after a death or failure
- Never prompt mid-gameplay
- Never prompt after a crash or error
- Never use custom review prompts to filter negative reviews to feedback forms (Apple rejects this)

### 8.3 Responding to Reviews

Responding to App Store reviews is visible to ALL users. Your responses are marketing.

**For Positive Reviews (4-5 stars):**
- Thank them briefly and specifically ("Glad you're enjoying the Mage class!")
- Tease upcoming content if relevant ("Wait until you see the new dungeon in the next update")

**For Negative Reviews (1-3 stars):**
- Acknowledge the issue professionally
- Provide a fix or workaround if applicable
- Mention if it's been fixed in an update
- Never be defensive or dismissive
- Invite them to contact you for help (provide email)
- A thoughtful response to a negative review can convince OTHER users to download

**Response Template for Bug Reports:**
```
Thanks for the report. We identified this issue and it's fixed in version X.X.
Update when you can and the [specific problem] should be resolved.
If you still see it, email us at support@forgeandcode.com -- we'll sort it out.
```

## 9. Getting Featured by Apple

Being featured by Apple is the single highest-impact event for an indie game's visibility. It's free, credible, and drives massive downloads. Apple has a dedicated indie games section on the App Store.

### 9.1 What Apple's Editorial Team Considers

There's no checklist, but they evaluate:
- **User experience**: Cohesive, efficient, valuable functionality
- **UI design**: Great usability, appeal, and overall quality
- **Innovation**: New technologies, unique approaches
- **Uniqueness**: Fresh approach that stands out
- **Accessibility**: Great experience for broad range of users
- **Localization**: High-quality support for multiple languages
- **Apple technology adoption**: Use of latest APIs, frameworks, platform features

### 9.2 How to Submit for Featuring

1. Go to **App Store Connect > Featuring Nominations**
2. Submit a nomination for your launch (or major update)
3. Provide: detailed description of the game, what's unique, why it deserves featuring, screenshots, video
4. Submit **at least 2 weeks before launch** (3 months preferred for wider consideration)

### 9.3 What Makes a Game Feature-Worthy

For Oasis to maximize featuring chances:

- [ ] **Use latest Apple technologies**: Metal rendering, Game Center integration, haptic feedback, Dynamic Island support if applicable
- [ ] **Excellent accessibility**: VoiceOver support, Dynamic Type, color blind options, reduced motion
- [ ] **Beautiful, original art**: Apple values aesthetic quality. The "illustrated painterly with HD-2D lighting" style is exactly what Apple likes to showcase.
- [ ] **Premium model**: Apple actively features premium games that aren't laden with aggressive monetization
- [ ] **iPad optimization**: Full iPad layout, not just phone upscaled. Apple loves to showcase iPad gaming.
- [ ] **Localization**: Even basic localization (5+ languages) signals quality
- [ ] **Clean, intuitive UI**: Apple's design language values simplicity
- [ ] **No performance issues**: Must run flawlessly on all supported devices

## 10. Localization Strategy

### 10.1 Localization ROI for Indie Games

80% of mobile game revenue comes from the top 6 language markets. Localization doesn't always increase downloads, but it significantly increases revenue-to-download ratio.

### 10.2 Language Priority Tiers

**Tier 1 -- Launch Languages (Highest ROI):**
- English (base)
- Japanese (Japan is #3 gaming market, loves RPGs and roguelikes)
- Simplified Chinese (massive market, growing premium appetite)
- Korean (strong mobile gaming culture)

**Tier 2 -- EFIGS Standard (Post-Launch Update):**
- French
- Italian
- German
- Spanish (Latin American Spanish preferred for wider reach)
- Brazilian Portuguese

**Tier 3 -- Extended Reach:**
- Traditional Chinese (Taiwan, Hong Kong)
- Russian
- Arabic
- Thai
- Turkish

### 10.3 What to Localize (Priority Order)

1. **App Store metadata** (title, subtitle, keywords, description) -- this is ASO, not just translation. Different keywords work in different languages.
2. **Screenshots** -- localized text overlays on screenshots dramatically improve conversion in non-English markets
3. **In-game UI text** -- menus, buttons, status effects
4. **In-game narrative** -- item descriptions, NPC dialogue, lore
5. **Preview video** -- subtitle overlays or localized text

**Critical insight:** Localization of App Store metadata can be done even before the game itself is localized. You can have English-only gameplay but Japanese keywords, screenshots with Japanese text, and a Japanese description. This captures search traffic while the full localization is in progress.

### 10.4 Localization is NOT Translation

Each locale needs:
- **Culturally relevant keywords** (not just translated keywords)
- **Adapted screenshot text** (idioms don't translate)
- **Appropriate cultural references** in descriptions
- **Locale-appropriate pricing** (regional price tiers)

Use native speakers or professional game localization services (LocalizeDirect, Keywords Studios). Machine translation for App Store metadata is a waste -- incorrect translations hurt more than no translation.

## 11. Case Studies: What Worked

### 11.1 Vampire Survivors

**What happened:** Solo developer (Poncle) created a simple auto-battler. Exploded on Steam through word-of-mouth and content creators. Mobile launch announced at The Game Awards 2022 and released same day.

**What worked:**
- Built massive PC audience FIRST, then brought them to mobile
- Free-to-play on mobile with non-intrusive opt-in ads (player controls when to watch ads)
- Surprise announcement + immediate release = maximum media coverage
- Developer made the mobile port in-house to preserve anti-predatory values
- Result: 3 million downloads in first month, 55-60K installs/day

**Lesson for Oasis:** Vampire Survivors had the luxury of an established PC fanbase. Oasis is mobile-first, so the lesson is: build community and anticipation BEFORE launch, and protect your monetization values publicly -- players notice and reward integrity.

### 11.2 Slay the Spire

**What happened:** Roguelike deckbuilder that launched in Steam Early Access. Initial sales were terrible (300 copies on day 1). Then weekly updates and influencer coverage slowly built momentum.

**What worked:**
- Weekly patches during Early Access created a cadence of content
- Influencer key distribution through Keymailer was crucial
- The game's MARKETABILITY (visually clear, easy to understand from a screenshot) drove organic sharing
- Mobile port ($9.99) succeeded on the back of PC reputation

**Lesson for Oasis:** Consistent updates post-launch are marketing events. If Oasis ships an update every 2-3 weeks in the first 3 months, that's 4-6 chances to re-enter visibility cycles. Also: make sure the game LOOKS clear and compelling in a single screenshot. Marketability is a design decision.

### 11.3 Stardew Valley

**What happened:** Solo dev (ConcernedApe) farming RPG. Became one of the best-selling indie games of all time. Mobile port at $4.99 -- premium, no ads, no IAP.

**What worked:**
- Complete game with hundreds of hours of content justified premium price
- Ongoing free updates maintained goodwill and press coverage for years
- Word of mouth in Reddit communities was the primary driver
- The premium "own everything" model created a passionate, loyal community
- Modding community on PC drove engagement; mobile benefited from cross-platform awareness

**Lesson for Oasis:** Buy Once Own Forever works when the game delivers genuine value. Stardew proved mobile players WILL pay $5+ for a complete experience. At $2.99, Oasis is an even easier impulse purchase. The key is making the game feel worth more than the price.

### 11.4 Monument Valley

**What happened:** Puzzle game by ustwo with stunning art. Premium priced ($3.99). Won Apple Design Award. Featured prominently by Apple.

**What worked:**
- Art style that made Apple WANT to feature it (beautiful = good marketing for Apple)
- Premium model aligned with Apple's preference for quality apps
- Short, polished experience -- quality over quantity
- Frank Underwood played it on House of Cards (organic celebrity placement)

**Lesson for Oasis:** Oasis's "illustrated painterly with HD-2D lighting" art style is EXACTLY what Apple likes to showcase. Invest in visual quality -- it's both a game design decision and a marketing decision. Beautiful games get featured. Featured games get downloaded.

### 11.5 Hades (Mobile via Netflix)

**What happened:** Supergiant's action roguelike, GOTY winner. Mobile port distributed through Netflix Games (free for subscribers).

**What worked:**
- Established franchise with critical acclaim
- Netflix distribution gave immediate massive install base
- Premium experience: no ads, no energy bars, no progress blockers
- Complete content from all previous versions included
- Touch controls were carefully redesigned for mobile

**Lesson for Oasis:** Hades proves the roguelike genre works brilliantly on mobile when the controls are right. Touch-optimized controls aren't a compromise -- they can be the BEST version. Oasis's virtual joystick + ability hotbar approach aligns with what worked for Hades.

## 12. Oasis Marketing Plan

### 12.1 Game Identity Summary

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|

| **Studio Values** | Buy Once, Own Forever. No subscriptions, no gacha. |

### 12.2 Competitive Positioning

**Category:** Roguelike dungeon crawlers on iOS App Store

**Competitive Landscape:**
- Crowded genre with many F2P entries (most low quality)
- Premium roguelikes exist but most are ports (Slay the Spire, Dead Cells)
- Few mobile-FIRST premium roguelikes with original art
- The D&D-inspired class/race system is uncommon in mobile roguelikes

**Positioning Statement:**
"Oasis is the premium mobile roguelike for players who want depth without predatory monetization. 16 builds, procedural dungeons, hand-painted art -- all for one price."

**Differentiators to Market:**
1. **Mobile-first** (not a port -- designed for touch from day one)
2. **16 unique builds** (class x race combinations = replayability)
3. **Original hand-painted art** (not pixel art, not asset-flip)
4. **10-minute sessions** (respects mobile players' time)
5. **Buy Once Own Forever** (no ads, no IAP, no energy timers)
6. **From Forge&Code** (indie studio that respects players)

| 8-10 | Promotional price drop ($0.99 weekend) | App Store, deal sites | Chart climbing |
| 12 | Major update + Year/Quarter retrospective | All channels | Long-tail growth |

### 12.5 Key Metrics to Track

| Metric | Tool | Target |
|--------|------|--------|
| App Store Impressions | App Store Connect | Trending up week over week |
| Product Page Views | App Store Connect | 20%+ of impressions |
| Conversion Rate | App Store Connect | 30%+ (premium games avg ~20-35%) |
| Keyword Rankings | AppTweak / Sensor Tower | Top 10 for 5+ keywords by month 2 |
| Downloads | App Store Connect | 1,000+ first month |
| Revenue | App Store Connect | Cover dev costs within 6 months |
| Rating | App Store | 4.5+ average |
| Review Count | App Store | 50+ reviews by month 3 |
| Discord Members | Discord | 200+ active by month 3 |
| TikTok Views | TikTok | 1M+ cumulative by month 3 |
| Social Followers | All platforms | 1,000+ total by month 3 |

### 12.6 Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Launch week downloads too low | Pre-built community + press coverage + influencer timing all coordinated for day 1 |
| Low conversion rate | A/B test screenshots immediately. Revise first 3 screenshots. Test icon variants. |
| Poor ratings (<4.0) | Ship stability patch within 48 hours. Respond to all reviews. Fix top-reported issues FAST. |
| No Apple featuring | Don't depend on it. Featuring is a bonus, not the plan. ASO + community must stand alone. |
| Keyword competition too high | Target long-tail keywords. "roguelike dungeon crawler" is competitive; "session roguelike premium" is less so. |
| TikTok content doesn't gain traction | Iterate formats. Try: humor, dev diary, class comparisons, dramatic deaths. Volume is key -- some will hit. |
| Premium price resistance | Emphasize value: "16 builds, procedural dungeons, no ads, 10-minute sessions -- all for less than a coffee." |

### 12.7 Post-Oasis: Building the Forge&Code Brand

Oasis is game one. The marketing plan should build toward the studio brand, not just the single game:

- **Forge&Code website** becomes the hub: all games, studio values, press kit, newsletter signup
- **"From the creators of Oasis"** becomes the trust signal for Forge&Table and beyond
- **The Forge&Code Discord** serves all games, not just Oasis
- **Email list** carries over: Oasis buyers are Forge&Table prospects
- **App Store developer page** becomes a destination: "All games by Forge&Code" should show a curated, premium catalog
- **Cross-promotion**: Oasis update mentions Forge&Table. Forge&Table includes Oasis engine integration. Each game sells the other.

The long game: Forge&Code becomes a recognized name in premium mobile gaming. Not famous -- recognized. Players see the name and think: "Their games are worth buying."
