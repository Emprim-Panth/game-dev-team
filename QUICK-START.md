## Fast Navigation

### "I'm starting a new game project"
1. Read: `spock-game-director.md` - Sections 1-3, 6
2. Skim: All other files' table of contents
3. Return when you need specific knowledge

### "I need procedural generation"
→ `scotty-game-developer.md` Section 4 (algorithms with full code)
→ `geordi-game-architect.md` Section 4 (architecture patterns)

### "I need combat balance"
→ `worf-game-balance.md` Section 3 (damage formulas, DPS, TTK)

### "I need to market my game"
→ `quark-game-marketing.md` Section 2 (ASO), Section 3 (Launch)

### "I need game audio"
→ `vic-game-audio.md` Section 5 (AI generation), Section 6 (adaptive music)

### "I need Godot-specific patterns"
→ `scotty-game-developer.md` Section 1-2, 6
→ `geordi-game-architect.md` Section 2

## Recommended Learning Path

### Week 1: Foundations
- [ ] Read README fully
- [ ] Read Spock sections 1-3 (role, day-to-day, decision frameworks)
- [ ] Skim all other files' tables of contents
- [ ] Goal: Understand what knowledge exists where

### Week 2: Deep Dive (Pick Your Focus)
Choose based on your immediate needs:

**Option A: "I'm designing a game"**
- Spock: Complete read
- Worf: Sections 2-4 (balance frameworks, combat math, roguelike principles)

**Option B: "I'm implementing systems"**
- Geordi: Sections 1-3 (patterns, Godot architecture, data-driven design)
- Scotty: Sections 1-2, 6 (Godot architecture, GDScript patterns, game patterns)

**Option C: "I'm launching a game"**
- Quark: Complete read
- Vic: Sections 5-8 (AI music generation, adaptive music, Godot audio)

### Week 3+: Reference Mode
Keep these files open as reference. Use table of contents + Cmd+F to jump to exactly what you need when you need it.

## Adapting for Different Projects

This knowledge was built for:
- Genre: Roguelike dungeon crawler
- Platform: iOS/iPad (mobile-first)
- Engine: Godot 4.x
- Business Model: Premium ($2.99, no ads)

**Highly transferable:**
- Spock's direction principles (universal)
- Worf's balance math (RPG-universal)
- Vic's music theory (universal)
- Geordi's architecture patterns (Godot-specific but adaptable)
- Scotty's implementation patterns (Godot-specific)

**Needs adaptation:**
- Quark's marketing (premium mobile-specific; F2P is different)
- Worf's roguelike balance (adjust for your genre)
- Scotty's procedural generation (if your game isn't procedural)

---

## Key Frameworks to Master

1. **Spock's Vision Test** (5 questions every feature must pass)
2. **Worf's Damage Formulas** (comparison of 5 options)
3. **Scotty's Component Pattern** (reusable behavior nodes)
4. **Geordi's Three-Layer Architecture** (visual, logic, data separation)
5. **Vic's Adaptive Music System** (vertical + horizontal design)
6. **Quark's ASO Metadata Stack** (title, subtitle, keywords)
